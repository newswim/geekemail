This is Geek on Wheels IT support in Denton. We are sending
out courtesy reminders to our ESET antivirus customers who have
subscriptions that are about to expire. Our records show that
your subscription will expire in 30 days.

We are offering our customers who renew ESET through us a
discount on computer optimization to help clean and speed up your
machine. If you renew with us before it expires you can receive a
25% discount on an optimization. Please bring your computer into
our store at 625 Dallas Dr. Suite 450 Denton, TX 76205 if you
would like to take advantage of this offer at the same time as
your renewal.

If you would like to renew or have any questions, please

You are also more than welcome to come into our storefront
between the hours of 8 am-8 pm Monday through Friday, Saturday 10
